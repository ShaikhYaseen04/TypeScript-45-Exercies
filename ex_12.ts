/*Assignment Number 12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print
a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized
with the person’s name.*/

let friendsName: string[] = ["Yaseen", "Ebad", "Mhosin", "Moeid"]

console.log(` Helle ${friendsName[0]}, how are you`)
console.log(` Helle ${friendsName[1]}, how are you`)
console.log(` Helle ${friendsName[2]}, how are you`)
console.log(` Helle ${friendsName[3]}, how are you`);
